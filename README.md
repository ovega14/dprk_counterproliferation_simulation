# dprk_counterproliferation_simulation
This repository contains scripts I wrote to simulate an air-based counterproliferation campaign by a US-led coalition aimed at neutralizing North Korean nuclear infrastructure. 
Completed as part of my final paper for the course 17.483 US Military Power, taught by Prof. Barry Posen and Zachary Burdette in Spring 2022 at MIT.
